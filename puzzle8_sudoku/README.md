# Sudoku





# Notes
1. Recursive algorithm for exhuastive search. Base case, implications and remember to clear the damage.
2. For complex checking conditions, additional helper function are coded to support in checking if condition is satisfied.

# Implementation details
1. Global varible backtrack can helps you count and estimate the computation complexity of the whole algorithm.
2. In python, some commonly used data structures can be used like set(),dictionary and other stuff. However, some data structure might be costy to implement within HW.
3. set also provides multiple interfaces for convenient usage. like set.difference() , set.union() etc...

# Iterative version
