# programming_for_puzzled_notes
1. You will all conform - Sliding window algorithm and the usage of boundary condition to simplify algorithm boundary checking.
2. Best time to party - Preprocessing of datas can greatly simplify the problem.
3. Card mind reading    - Encode and decode of information, Modulo arithmetic.
4. Do break the crystal - Radix and number, basic algorithmic analysis.
5. Eight queens problem - Brute force search,data structure representation ,symmetry, rotation of same problem for search space pruning.
6. A profusion of queen - Transform the original iterative eight queen into recursive version.
7. Tile that courtyard  - Divide and Conquer, creation of sub-problems to simplify complicated problem.
8. Sudoku               - Recursive Backtracking problem, undoing the damage to do Brute force search. Heuristic search algorithm can reduce the time complexity of algorithm.
9. Disorganized handyman - Pivot quickSort, Mergesort, complexity of these algorithm and in-place QuickSort algorithm.
10. Weekend to remember  - Graph Representation, Bipartite, check two colourable.
11. Memory serves you well - Advanced Recursive divide and Conquer, Multiple base cases analysis and introduction to dynamic programming.
